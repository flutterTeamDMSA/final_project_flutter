Why was the product created?
The project was inspired by the desire to simplify the process of monitoring nutrition and health. Many people are faced with difficulties in calculating calories and macro elements in their diet due to the complexity of diets and the lack of time for a thorough analysis of each product. We sought to create a convenient solution that would allow users to easily and quickly find out the calorie content of their meal, simply photographing it.

The purpose of the product?
The purpose of our application is to satisfy the needs of users in the exact and quick calculation of calories based on a photograph of food. We want to help people who want to control their food, but have difficulties with accurate calculation of calories and macro elements. Our application helps to make this process easier and more effective, freeing user time for other tasks.

What is the best anallain?
Our application differs in its simplicity of use. In the difference from many other applications that require the entry of each ingredient manually, our application analyzes the photo and determines the food products on it, and then uses the calorie database to calculate the total number of calories. This makes the process much faster and more convenient for the user
